# MusicGenreClassification
## Data and Preprocessing
Three datasets namely tracks, genre, and echonest have been used for this project (Data can be downloaded from https://github.com/mdeff/fma). 
The datasets are preprocessed by reindexing the columns and rows and dropping the rows containing missing values. The final dataset has been generated by making use of the track and genre datasets to retain samples present in the echonest dataset. The final generated dataset contained 247 features. 

## Techniques
Feature selection techniques such as wrapper-based like Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) and filter-like variance thresholds have been implemented. Both the SFS and SFFS techniques have selected the same set of top 3 important features out of 247 features. Feature reduction techniques have been applied to the dataset to reduce the dimensionality. Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) have been implemented. 

## Analysis
From their corresponding 3-D plots, the LDA technique created better low-dimensional visualization compared to the PCA technique. Various classification models have been implemented on these reduced datasets to compare the performance of the classifiers. Models performed better on data reduced by the LDA technique than compared to data reduced by the PCA technique as LDA considers class labels while reducing the data. Out of all the models, the Bayes Classifier performed better on both datasets.

## Future Work
The performance of these classifier models can be improved by various methods such as by hypertuning the parameters of the classifier models, increasing the number of features into consideration(dimensions>3), etc.
